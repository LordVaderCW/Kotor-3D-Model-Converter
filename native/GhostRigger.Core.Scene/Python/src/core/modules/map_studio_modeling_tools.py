"""KOTOR-aware modeling tool palette for Map Studio.

This module is deliberately headless.  It describes the manual modeling modes,
snap modes, and tool intent that the Level Editor exposes while the actual mesh
editing services mature.  Keeping these labels and guardrails in core prevents
the GUI from becoming the owner of Map Studio workflow policy.
