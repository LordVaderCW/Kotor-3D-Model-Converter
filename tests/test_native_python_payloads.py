    # module-repair and exact vanilla-texture-port workflows add their typed
    # Workflow/GUI/Automation payloads.
    # The prepared live-topology evaluator is packaged by both Scene (owner)
    # and Tools (embedded consumer), adding two byte-identical payload rows.
    # Core.Math also owns the direct manifold3d closed-solid Boolean kernel.
    # The Maya-style Map Studio shelf, neutral component marking menu, and
    # non-mutating Multi-Cut session add eight owner/consumer payload rows.
    # Retained primitive construction now packages the connected logical cage
    # and topology-budget policy through both Scene and Tools.
    # The PIE gameplay entity registry (map_studio_pie_entities.py) ships
    # through both Scene and Tools.
    # The modular-map room catalog (map_studio_room_catalog.py) ships through
    # both Scene and Tools, adding two byte-identical payload rows.
    # Doorway snapping (map_studio_room_snapping.py) ships through both too,
    # adding another two byte-identical payload rows.
    # Scene-animation NCS intent extraction (map_studio_scene_animations.py)
    # ships through both, adding another two byte-identical payload rows.
    # Animated PIE door actors (map_studio_pie_doors.py) ship through both,
    # adding another two byte-identical payload rows.
    # The composed PIE gameplay coordinator and typed template-resource
    # projection ship through Scene and Tools, adding four payload rows.
    # The standalone GUI Editor window/workflow and renderer-neutral KOTOR
    # GUI preview contract add three owner payload rows.
    # Unity transfer/export is now owned only by Core.IO; the stale Tools copy
    # was removed so DLL discovery order cannot select divergent behavior.
    # Engine-compatible FBX take selection adds one Workflow service plus the
    # mirrored GUI Display/Tools selector dialog payloads.
    # 2026-07-17: the Map Studio PIE gameplay-simulation core ships through both
    # Scene and Tools — dialogue, dialogue cameras, triggers, party, combat,
    # resources, interactions, gameplay coordinator — plus the bounded OnEnter
    # scripting-state reader (map_studio_pie_scripting.py) and the runtime quest
    # log (map_studio_pie_journal.py), each adding a byte-identical
    # owner/consumer payload pair.
    # 2026-07-17: the clean-room NCS virtual machine
    # (map_studio_pie_nwscript_vm.py) and the scripted-event/cinematic playback
    # runtime (map_studio_pie_scripted_events.py) ship through Scene and Tools,
    # adding two more byte-identical owner/consumer payload pairs.
    # 2026-07-18: editable KOTOR GUI documents and transactional GUI IO add
    # one Core.Tools owner payload and one Core.IO owner payload.
    # Automatic file-level MDL inspection/import adds one Core.IO owner
    # payload shared by all GUI and tool entry points.
    # 2026-07-19: the independent Custom Rigged Character Builder adds its
    # versioned Project model, Validation snapshot/rules, three Workflow
    # services (import/build/package), and three GUI Display entry/controller
    # surfaces. Native Character Builder payload ownership is unchanged.
    # Installed UTC behavior authoring adds one Resources catalog owner and one
    # Workflow behavior compiler/profile owner.
    # 2026-07-20: the KOTOR emitter particle system adds four Core.Rendering
    # payloads (src/core/particles: __init__, emitter_data, simulation,
    # emitter_library) plus the ModernGL billboard pass
    # (adapters/rendering/moderngl_particles.py) and the Core.Tools Particle
    # Editor window (gui/windows/qt_particle_editor.py).
    # The retail-style glow post-process adds the Core.Rendering bloom pass
    # (adapters/rendering/moderngl_bloom.py).
    # 2026-07-21: retail particle-placeable compilation adds the Workflow
    # owner that bakes emitters into MDL/MDX and allocates placeables.2da.
    # Custom-map authoring adds the reviewed OBJ parser/import service and UI,
    # plus the panorama/HDR conversion adapter and its compact options dialog.
        # The focused terrain sculpt shelf ships through Tools and GUI Display;
        # the terrain-kit catalog/compiler ships through Scene and its visual
        # browser ships through Tools and GUI Display, adding five payload rows.
        # Pascal-style direct building and learned retail environment palettes

        # environment-kit catalog and its visual room-piece browser add paired
        # Scene/Tools and GUI Display/Tools payload rows.
    # The stable-ID Pascal wall graph and T-junction planarizer ship through
    # Scene and the embedded Tools consumer, adding two payload rows.
    # The versioned Custom Head Builder project/evidence contract adds one
    # Core.Workflow owner payload.
    # Head Builder Slice 2 adds its atomic Project repository, Resources donor
    # catalog/install verifier, and Workflow donor snapshot/service: five
    # additional owner payloads.
    # Head Builder Slice 3 adds the Core.IO custom-art contract and Core.Math
    # named-space headhook alignment solver: two additional owner payloads.
    # Head Builder Slice 4 adds donor-preserving head skin transfer in Core
    # Math and geometry-transplant orchestration in Core Workflow.
    # Head Builder Slice 5 adds UV orientation in Core Math, texture inspection
    # in Core IO, and material-policy orchestration in Core Workflow.
    # Head Builder Slice 6 adds exact-headhook attachment and inherited
    # animation preview orchestration in Core Workflow.
    # Head Builder Slice 7 adds raw binary export/readback in Core IO and
    # head-specific structural preflight in Core Validation.
    # Head Builder Slice 8 adds merge-safe game records plus transactional
    # package/install/restore IO.
    # The production Head Builder UI adds one GUI Display workspace, one Core
    # Tools controller, and the Tools-side namespace initializer used to join
    # that controller to the canonical Qt controller package.
    # Stock face/eyes/eyelids/hair recipes add one Core Workflow inventory
    # and assembly owner plus one Core Math named-space rebase helper.
    # Purpose-led Map Studio spatial plans ship through Scene and the embedded
    # Tools consumer, adding two byte-identical payload rows.
    # The authenticated Ghost Studio bridge adds three Automation payloads
    # (shared HMAC/session security plus its two-file narrow MCP package) and
    # one Scene-owned revisioned spatial snapshot serializer.
    # Facial Performance Head adds the source-agnostic facial clip, the
    # geometry-backed range audit, head-art anatomy/transplant services, and
    # the two-file ARKit input adapter to the Core.Workflow payload.
