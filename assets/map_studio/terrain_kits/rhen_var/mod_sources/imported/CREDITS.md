## Conversion Record

Visual render meshes were extracted to GLB with `swbf-unmunge` 1.3.0,
normalized in Blender 4.2 to metres/Z-up, and packaged as OBJ/MTL with
power-of-two diffuse TGAs. High-detail render geometry, UV0, normals, material
assignments, and diffuse alpha were retained. Source low-resolution, collision,
and shadow-volume nodes were intentionally excluded from visual geometry.
Runtime collision intent is declared per asset in the pack manifest.
