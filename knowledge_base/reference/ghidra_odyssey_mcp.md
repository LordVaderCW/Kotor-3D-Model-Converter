# Odyssey Ghidra MCP Workflow

Purpose: use the AgentDecompile/Ghidra MCP bridge as engine ground truth when
GhostRigger behavior depends on `swkotor.exe` / `swkotor2.exe` binary semantics.

Do not commit server credentials or MCP passwords into the repository. Keep
connection secrets in the local MCP configuration only.

## Available Tool Surface

The GhostRigger MCP exposes these Ghidra-backed helpers:

- `kotor_binary_ping()` - verify the AgentDecompile backend and known programs.
- `kotor_binary_info(game="k1" | "k2")` - confirm the loaded executable.
- `kotor_search_symbols(game, query)` - find named functions/globals.
- `kotor_search_engine_strings(game, pattern)` - find string literals.
- `kotor_decompile_function(game, function)` - get decompiler output or
  disassembly when the decompiler process is unavailable.
- `kotor_get_references(game, address_or_symbol, direction)` - list callers or
  callees.
- `kotor_call_graph(game, function, depth)` - inspect subsystem call flow.
- `kotor_data_flow(game, function_address, start_address, direction)` - trace
  local value flow.
- `kotor_inspect_memory(game, address, mode, length)` - inspect raw memory,
  data, vtables, and static tables.

Use `game="k1"` for `/K1/k1_win_gog_swkotor.exe` and `game="k2"` for
`/K2/swkotor2.exe`.

## Export-Crash Pattern: MaxTree Subtype

K1 live testing exposed a crash in `InputBinary::Read` at `0x004A136D`. Ghidra
ground truth:

- `MaxTree::AsModel` at `0x0043E1C0` reads byte `[ECX + 0x4C]`.
- It masks that byte with `0x7F`.
- It returns `(Model *)this` only when the masked subtype equals `0x02`.
- `InputBinary::Read` then writes through `[EAX + 0xB4]`; if `AsModel` returned
  null, this becomes an access violation.

Writer implication:

- Top-level MDL geometry header must write `0x02` at geometry block `+0x4C`.
- Animation geometry blocks must write `0x05` at animation block `+0x4C`.
- These bytes are engine-facing MaxTree subtypes, not display metadata.

The regression test is `tests/test_roundtrip_verification.py::
test_mdl_writer_sets_engine_maxtree_subtype_bytes`.

## Model Header Size

PyKotor's `_ModelHeader.SIZE` is `0xC4` / 196 bytes. That size includes:

- `0x00..0x4F`: 80-byte geometry header;
- `0x50..0xC3`: 116 bytes of model fields.

The late model fields are engine-facing and must not be moved behind a custom
GhostRigger name-block header:

- `+0xA8` `offset_to_super_root` should point at the model root node offset;
- `+0xAC` `mdx_data_buffer_offset` is usually 0 for the emitted MDX buffer;
- `+0xB0` `mdx_size` must match the MDX byte length;
- `+0xB4` `mdx_offset` is usually 0 for the companion MDX;
- `+0xB8` `offset_to_name_offsets` points to the uint32 name-offset table;
- `+0xBC` and `+0xC0` are duplicate name-offset counts.

Stock `PMBAM` has `offset_to_name_offsets = 0xC4`, meaning the name-offset
table starts immediately after `_ModelHeader`. GhostRigger exports should keep
that canonical layout unless a specific source file requires preservation of a
different valid offset.

The regression test is `tests/test_roundtrip_verification.py::
test_mdl_writer_emits_full_engine_model_header_fields`.

## Animation Footprint Tree

K1 live testing with a custom local `victory` animation reached
`UpdateAnimFootprint` at `0x00437db0` and crashed at `0x00437f3f`:

- the function reads the child array pointer/count from the current animation
  node header (`[EDI + 0x2C]` / `[EDI + 0x30]`);
- it indexes into that child array and treats each child offset as a full node;
- it immediately reads fields such as `[EDI + 0x48]` from the child node.

Writer implication:

- Do not export sparse animation trees containing only keyed nodes plus
  ancestors.
- Local animation blocks must preserve the target Aurora node hierarchy shape:
  every target node, original parent/child relationships, and valid child arrays
  must be emitted even when the node has no controllers.
- Unkeyed nodes should be controllerless placeholder animation nodes, not
  omitted nodes and not fake header-count-only entries.

The regression test is `tests/test_roundtrip_verification.py::
test_mdl_writer_exports_full_target_hierarchy_for_sparse_animation_tree`.

## K1 Animation Parent-Edge Binding

K1 `AnimateHierarchy` at `0x00483d80` recursively pairs an animation Part with
the corresponding geometry node, then searches only that geometry parent's
immediate children by node ID. It does not globally resolve every animation
node by name or ID.

Writer implication:

- Correct animation names, node IDs, controllers, and raw offsets are not
  sufficient when a retargeted node retains its donor parent.
- Every carried animation parent edge must match the target model's direct
  parent edge.
- When a donor clip omits target-only intermediary nodes, export must insert
  controllerless target ancestors rather than attaching the child to its
  nearest surviving donor ancestor.
- A sparse tree may omit unrelated target siblings, matching stock creature
  clips, as long as the serialized nodes form a target-native ancestor closure.

The K1 Lorum fixture exposed this exact failure: 268 Dark-Jedi-derived clips
contained 1,331 wrong parent edges while all 16 native Ithorian clips were
clean. The repeated breaks bypassed `RShoulder_g`, `LShoulder_g`, the Ithorian
neck chain, and `torso_g`; GhostRigger preview still moved because it binds
controllers by name, while retail KOTOR left the creature rigid. The writer
regression is `tests/test_roundtrip_verification.py::
test_mdl_writer_rebuilds_donor_parent_edges_on_target_hierarchy`.

## Recommended Use

Use Ghidra MCP when:

- a generated MDL crashes the game but GhostRigger/PyKotor can parse it;
- a writer offset or subtype byte is uncertain;
- live engine behavior differs from viewport/readback behavior;
- a K1/K2 binary behavior difference is suspected.

Record durable findings in `knowledge_base/` and add a focused regression test
near the writer/loader code that consumed the finding.
