# GhostRigger Phased C++ Integration Foundation

Date: 2026-06-07
Branch: `qt-ghostrigger`
Status: Foundation document
Related: `knowledge_base/native_migration_plan.md`, `native/README.md`

## Purpose

This document is the strict foundation for adopting the C++ hosted architecture
across GhostRigger. It defines how the native host, native DLL projects,
renderer packages, shared systems, and Python bridge are allowed to grow.
Package ownership and naming authority now lives in
`knowledge_base/package_ownership_model.md`. If older Phase 1 project names in
this document conflict with that model, treat them as current build
compatibility state and migrate them through a coordinated rename/merge instead
of copying them into new work.

The goal is not a wholesale rewrite. The goal is to keep Python excellent at
workflow orchestration and UI while C++ takes ownership of the hot paths that
benefit from direct memory control, native graphics APIs, fast rasterisation,
GPU resource ownership, model-runtime residency, skinning, picking, streaming,
and other performance-sensitive systems.

## Core Architecture Statement

`GhostStudio.exe` is the owning process. It is built by the `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Host`
Visual Studio project, embeds Python, and runs the
existing Qt application in-process. Because C++ and Python now share the same
process, Python can access native C++ functionality through stable bridge
surfaces instead of launching sidecar processes or duplicating runtime logic.

Allowed bridge surfaces:

1. C ABI DLLs loaded by Python through `ctypes` or `cffi`.
2. Python extension modules (`.pyd`) imported directly by Python.
3. Host-registered Python modules created by `GhostStudio.exe` before
   `main.py` runs.
4. Narrow shared-handle APIs for host-owned runtime objects such as renderer
   devices, retained scenes, buffers, textures, skin palettes, and frame
   contexts.

The C ABI DLL route is the baseline because it is testable from C++ DEBUG
programs and Python without requiring the full GUI. Richer `.pyd` or
host-registered modules may be added only when the owning system needs a more
expressive Python API and still preserves a targeted native DEBUG path.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- Every durable native system must live in its own Visual Studio project or in
  a clearly named shared native project. Do not pile unrelated systems into
  `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Host` or a convenient runtime file.
- Shared code used by more than one toolbox, renderer, window, or native
  system belongs in a shared native project. Do not duplicate the same C++ logic
  across renderer DLLs or toolbox DLLs.
- Python remains the current UI/workflow owner until an explicit native UI
  decision is made. Native systems expose services; Python decides user intent.
- Renderer implementations are DLL packages. The host or Python bridge selects
  them through a renderer contract; UI code never reaches directly into a
  renderer's private implementation.
- The native host owns process startup, embedded Python configuration, and
  host-wide native module registration. Feature DLLs do not initialize Python.
- Backend/model-pipeline migrations must be proven against game-file truth
  using the GhostRigger MCP tools before replacing Python behavior.
- UI, startup, viewport, theme/layout, and workflow behavior must be tested in
  the visible GhostRigger application. Backend probes and MCP tools are not a
  substitute for visual UI testing.
- Native adoption must be incremental. A native path can become the default only
  after the Python path, native path, diagnostics, and visible behavior agree on
  targeted fixtures.
- Every package must have a durable reason to exist. Merge diagnostic-only,
  duplicate, or thin wrapper projects into the canonical owner unless a real
  runtime, ABI, adapter, product, subsystem, dependency, or deployment boundary
  justifies keeping them separate.
- Do not create new projects under broad compatibility namespaces such as
  `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*` boundaries. Use `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Helpers.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.Project.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Session`, or `GhostRigger.Core.Automation` as the
  ownership model requires.

## Native Project Shape

The Visual Studio solution should grow as a set of deliberately small projects:

| Project type | Output | Owns | Must not own |
|--------------|--------|------|--------------|
| Host | `.exe` | Embedded Python startup, process lifetime, host modules, global native services | Toolbox logic, renderer internals, file-format policy |
| Bridge contract | `.dll` and headers | Stable C ABI, handle types, version/capability queries, diagnostics | Renderer-specific device code |
| Shared native core | `.lib` or `.dll` | Math, memory helpers, handles, diagnostics packets, common resource descriptors | UI decisions, game-specific guesses |
| Toolbox native package | `.dll` or `.pyd` | One feature system such as animation runtime, model runtime, skinning, picking, export/readback helper | Unrelated toolbox behavior |
| Renderer package | `.dll` | One renderer backend and its GPU/device/resource implementation | Python UI state, non-renderer workflow policy |
| Debug configuration | real package output | Native ABI and project-level regression checks without Python/GUI | Product workflow replacement or parallel `.DEBUG` solution app |

Each new native project must declare:

- Owning product surface, such as Main Viewport/KMAX, Character Studio,
  Retarget Workbench, Module Studio, Map Studio, Resource Browser, Validation,
  Export, or Project/session infrastructure.
- Owning code package, such as
  `native/GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`,
  `native/GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `src/adapters/rendering/native_core`, or `src/core/rendering`.
- Python bridge method: C ABI, `.pyd`, host module, or shared-handle API.
- Data ownership: which side owns allocation, mutation, lifetime, and cleanup.
- Verification gate: native Debug target, targeted Python test, MCP comparison, and
  visible app check where applicable.

## Shared-System Rule

Anything used conjunctively or collectively by multiple toolboxes, windows, or
renderers must be a shared project. Examples include:

- Stable native handle allocation and lookup.
- Renderer-neutral mesh, material, texture, skin-palette, animation-sample, and
  frame descriptor structs.
- Matrix, quaternion, transform, bounds, and ray helpers used by both renderer
  and picking systems.
- Diagnostics packet schemas and capability reporting.
- Resource residency bookkeeping that more than one renderer consumes.
- CPU fallback routines that must match GPU or renderer output.

Shared projects must expose small APIs and versioned structs. They should not
know about Qt widgets, dock panels, theme/layout state, or user workflow
commands.

## Renderer Package Rule

Renderer-neutral contracts, render state, materials, texture upload policy,
renderer resources, backend interfaces, and backend implementations belong
under `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering.*`. Each renderer backend may remain a
separate package when it represents a real backend/runtime/dependency boundary,
but renderer packages must not depend on each other's implementation details.

Canonical renderer packages should follow this shape:

- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: renderer-neutral native interfaces, descriptor
  structs, capability flags, diagnostics, draw-list records, and shared handle
  types.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: renderer-neutral material contracts
  when material policy needs its own owner.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: renderer-neutral texture upload and
  sampler policy when texture behavior needs its own owner.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: Windows Direct3D 12 renderer
  package.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: ModernGL renderer package
  when it has a real backend boundary beyond Python adapter glue.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: PyGFX/WGPU renderer package
  when it has a real backend boundary beyond Python adapter glue.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`: diagnostic fallback package for
  tests and failure reporting, not a product-facing renderer mode.

`GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` and
`GhostRigger.Core.Rendering.*` are current canonical native names when
a real renderer-neutral contract or backend runtime boundary exists. They
should be merged only if a future batch proves the boundary is unnecessary and
updates project directories, `.vcxproj` files, filters, the solution, payload
manifests, package registry entries, tests, and compatibility shims.

Renderer DLLs should own:

- Device/context creation for that backend.
- GPU resource allocation and residency.
- Upload queues, resource transitions, pipeline state, shaders, and draw
  submission.
- Renderer-local diagnostics and frame statistics.
- Native picking/readback only when the renderer contract defines it.

Renderer DLLs must not own:

- Qt toolbar state, settings dialogs, or theme/layout application.
- KOTOR resource discovery or game-file truth decisions.
- Project save/load policy.
- Workflow-specific UI behavior such as Retarget Workbench controls.

## Python Access Contract

Python may call native systems, but native systems must keep the Python-facing
surface narrow.

Good Python-facing APIs:

- `create_scene() -> handle`
- `destroy_scene(handle)`
- `upload_mesh(scene, mesh_descriptor, vertex_payload, index_payload)`
- `update_transform(scene, mesh_id, matrix)`
- `query_capabilities() -> dict`
- `get_diagnostics(scene) -> dict`
- `render_frame(scene, frame_descriptor)`

Poor Python-facing APIs:

- APIs that require Python to poke at renderer-private structures.
- APIs that return raw mutable internal pointers without ownership rules.
- APIs that encode Qt widget state into native renderer objects.
- APIs that duplicate Python-side parsing or export policy before a migration
  gate proves the native version.

All Python wrappers must handle missing DLLs, version mismatch, unsupported
backend capabilities, and clean fallback without corrupting the active scene.

## Phase 1: Foundations And Plumbing

Purpose: establish the native host, bridge contracts, project boundaries, and
first shared runtime handles without moving product behavior prematurely.

Current completed foundation:

- `GhostStudio.exe` hosts embedded Python in-process from the `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Host` project.
- The native host starts `main.py --gui qt` without launching a separate Python
  process.
- `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll` exists as the first shared native core package for
  renderer/toolbox-neutral version, capability, diagnostics, and handle
  foundations.
- `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll` exists as the first shared
  native core extension package for renderer/toolbox-neutral diagnostic record
  schema metadata and simple record formatting.
- `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll` exists as the shared native core
  math package for renderer/toolbox-neutral bounds, center, and matrix
  point-transform helpers.
- `GhostRigger.Runtime.Core.Host.dll` exists as the first C ABI bridge boundary.
- `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` exists as the first `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared.*`
  package for renderer-neutral contract metadata shared by future runtime and
  renderer packages.
- `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` exists as the first renderer-neutral
  runtime descriptor package for shared mesh, material, and frame descriptor
  schema metadata.
- `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` exists as the renderer-neutral
  resource residency schema package for resource identifiers, residency records,
  upload packets, and transition packets.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` exists as the current
  legacy renderer-neutral build target for backend capability, surface,
  draw-item, and frame-stat schema metadata before D3D12/WGPU implementation
  DLLs are introduced. Its canonical target owner is
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` exists as the current legacy
  first concrete diagnostic renderer backend build target. Its canonical target
  owner is `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`; it is diagnostic-only
  and proves backend package shape without owning a real GPU device.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` exists as the current legacy
  first hardware renderer backend build target. Its canonical target owner is
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`; it can probe DXGI
  adapters, probe D3D12 feature-level 12_0 device-readiness without retaining a
  device, report command-queue/swap-chain readiness requirements without
  creating either object, create/destroy a diagnostic context that retains a
  D3D12 device and direct command queue for lifetime validation, retain
  diagnostic descriptor heaps, a direct command allocator, and a closed direct
  command list, report descriptor-heap/command-allocator/command-list readiness
  metadata, report native surface/swap-chain handle readiness metadata, report
  render-target/back-buffer metadata, report resource-barrier/clear-pass
  metadata, report command-recording dry-run frame metadata, run guarded
  command-list reset/close diagnostics, run guarded no-draw command
  execution/fence readiness diagnostics, report present-readiness metadata, run
  guarded swap-chain creation diagnostics behind an explicit native window
  handle, run guarded back-buffer acquisition and RTV creation diagnostics, run
  guarded render-target barrier/clear recording diagnostics, report guarded
  clear-pass command execution/fence diagnostics, report post-clear
  present-readiness diagnostics, run guarded present-call diagnostics, report
  post-present frame/accounting diagnostics, report native draw-list readiness
  metadata, report native resource-binding readiness metadata, report
  pipeline-state/root-signature readiness metadata, report guarded
  shader-bytecode metadata, report shader reflection/input-layout metadata,
  report guarded root-signature metadata, report guarded pipeline-state object
  metadata, report guarded draw-command recording metadata, report guarded
  draw-submission readiness metadata, report guarded post-draw frame/accounting
  readiness metadata, and report failure-diagnostic schema metadata, but it is
  still diagnostic-only in Phase 1
  and does not record draws or enable real draw submission. `Present` is only
  reachable through the guarded present-call diagnostic after prior swap-chain,
  back-buffer, RTV, clear-pass, and fence readiness gates pass.

  without Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Runtime.Core.Host` Debug-target ABI check validates the runtime ABI without Python.
- Native handle/retained-scene bridge work has begun through the runtime
  contract.
- `src.adapters.native_core.package_registry` can detect
  `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll`,
  `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll`, and
  `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.dll`, and
  `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared`, and
  `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared`, and
  `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`, and `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`, `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` availability and capabilities from
  Python without starting the GUI. The D3D12 registry entry exposes the complete
  guarded Phase 1 metadata capability set advertised by the native DLL.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exists as the first native toolbox package
  boundary. It reports Retarget Workbench owner metadata, package capabilities,
  and a solve-packet schema placeholder while keeping native solve execution
  disabled and requiring the Python Retarget Workbench fallback.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` Debug-target ABI check validates the Retargeting toolbox
  package ABI, owner-boundary metadata, capabilities export, and solve-packet
  schema placeholder without Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exists as the native toolbox package boundary
  for export and validation helpers. It reports export workflow owner metadata,
  package capabilities, and a preflight-packet schema placeholder while keeping
  native file writes disabled and requiring the Python export fallback.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` Debug-target ABI check validates the Export toolbox package
  ABI, owner-boundary metadata, capabilities export, and preflight-packet schema

  metadata, package capabilities, and an autofit-packet schema placeholder while
  keeping native autofit disabled and requiring the Python Character Studio
  fallback.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` Debug-target ABI check validates the Character
  Builder toolbox package ABI, owner-boundary metadata, capabilities export, and
  autofit-packet schema placeholder without Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exist as Phase 1 browser/catalogue tool
  package boundaries. They report package capabilities, owner-boundary metadata,
  and catalogue/table schema placeholders while keeping native indexing and
  table queries disabled and requiring Python fallback.
- Their Debug-target ABI checks verify the browser/catalogue package ABIs,
  capabilities exports, owner-boundary metadata, and schema placeholders without
  Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, and `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exist
  as Phase 1 scene/workbench tool package boundaries. They report package
  capabilities, owner-boundary metadata, and scene/property/lighting/camera/
  module-mesh packet schema placeholders while keeping native scene querying,
  property edits, light/camera evaluation, and module-mesh indexing disabled and
  requiring Python fallback.
- Their Debug-target ABI checks verify the scene/workbench package ABIs,
  capabilities exports, owner-boundary metadata, and schema placeholders without
  Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exist as the remaining requested Phase
  1 toolbox package boundaries. They report package capabilities,
  owner-boundary metadata, and attachment/node-tree/material/pivot/sequence
  packet schema placeholders while keeping native attachment evaluation,
  node-tree queries, sprite-material evaluation, pivot edits, and sequence
  evaluation disabled and requiring Python fallback.
- Their Debug-target ABI checks verify the remaining toolbox package ABIs,
  capabilities exports, owner-boundary metadata, and schema placeholders without
  Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display` exists as the current legacy Phase 1
  native window compatibility package for main-window host services. Its future
  owner must be selected from GUI Display, Automation, Project/Session, or
  NativeHost according to `knowledge_base/package_ownership_model.md`. It
  reports main-window owner metadata, package capabilities, and a host-service
  schema placeholder while keeping the Python/Qt main window as the visible
  shell owner.
- `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display` Debug-target ABI check validates the main-window package
  ABI, owner-boundary metadata, capabilities export, and host-service schema
  placeholder without Python or the GUI.
- `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools` exist as current legacy
  Phase 1 native window compatibility packages for the extra
  standalone/workbench windows. Future work should merge them into the owning
  Tool, GUI Display, GUI Helpers, Project/Session, or Automation package unless
  a real runtime, ABI, dependency, or deployment reason keeps them separate.
  They report package capabilities, owner-boundary metadata, and host-service
  schema placeholders while keeping the Python/Qt windows as the visible shell
  owners.
- Their Debug-target ABI checks verify the extra window package ABIs,
  owner-boundary metadata, capabilities exports, and host-service schema
  placeholders without Python or the GUI.
- `native/GhostRigger.Native.Core.HostModulePackages.json` records the full Phase 1
  Python module sweep. The generated Visual Studio package pairs include
  `GhostRigger.Core.Scene` for `src/core/modules`, the core domains, top-level
  support packages, adapter category packages, GUI category packages, KOTOR MCP
  validation support, and `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`.
- The generated module package DLLs are diagnostic-only: they report C ABI
  version/capability metadata, owner-boundary metadata, and dependency-scan
  schema metadata while keeping `native_implementation_enabled:false` and
  `python_fallback_required:true`.
- Their Debug-target ABI checks verify the generated module package ABIs,
  owner-boundary metadata, and dependency-schema placeholders without Python or
  the GUI.
- `native/GhostRigger.PythonPayloadManifest.json` records the Phase 1.5
  embedded Python payload sweep. The payload map covers all 18 non-DEBUG native
  DLL projects and every `src/**/*.py` file at least once.
- The Phase 1.5 payload copies live under
  `native/<Project>/Python/src/...` and are built into native DLLs as
  `RCDATA` resources through per-project `GhostRiggerPythonPayload.rc` files,
  alongside per-project `GhostRiggerPythonPayload.json` manifests.
- The manifest contains 1,118 packaged Python file references. Duplicate source
  references are permitted only when separate runtime, renderer, window, shared
  runtime, or diagnostic native-core boundaries need the same Python owner.
- Phase 1.5 does not change runtime import behavior. The packaged Python files
  are byte-identical DLL payload copies; the active application still imports
  originals from `src/` until a later native bridge, extraction, or import path
  is deliberately enabled.
- Every payload DLL exposes the shared Phase 1.5 C ABI
  `gr_python_payload_manifest_json()` and `gr_python_payload_file_count()` so
  native code and embedded Python can verify the DLL-owned Python payload
  boundary without executing copied Python files.
- `GhostStudio.exe` has build-order project references to every payload DLL and
  runs a startup dependency audit before embedded Python executes `main.py`.
  After the native log console opens, the host loads each DLL, checks
  version/capability exports, reads the payload file count, and writes the
  audit directly to the console before Python emits the normal `main.py`
  startup log.
- `native/templates/` contains Phase 1 Visual Studio project templates for
  native DLL packages and real-project Debug verification targets, with
  ownership metadata and changelog requirements.

Native project naming foundation:

- The three anchor C++ projects are `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Host`, `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation`,
  and `GhostRigger.Runtime.Core.Host`.
- Additional shared systems that extend the core foundation should use
  `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.{System}` naming.
- Additional runtime-shared contracts that multiple runtime or renderer
  packages consume should use `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared.{System}` naming.
- Concrete toolbox packages that migrate Python toolbox logic to C++ use
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools.{Toolname}` naming, for example
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`, or
  `GhostRigger.Core.Tools`.
- Visible UI packages use `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*`; interactive helper
  packages use `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Helpers.*`. Existing
  `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*` projects are legacy Phase 1 compatibility packages,
  not new naming precedent.
- Python module sweep packages must map to the canonical owners in
  `knowledge_base/package_ownership_model.md`: `GhostRigger.Core.IO.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Automation`, `GhostRigger.Core.Scene.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Resources.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.IO`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Math.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Validation.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.Project.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.Session`, `GhostRigger.Core.Workflow.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Systems.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.Tools.*`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*`, `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Helpers.*`, and
  `GhostRigger.Core.Qt`, `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`,
  `GhostRigger.Core.IO`, and `GhostRigger.Core.Unreal`.
- Concrete renderer packages use `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering.{Backend}`
  naming, for example `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` or the
  diagnostic `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering`.

Required remaining foundation work:

- Audit existing Visual Studio projects against
  `knowledge_base/package_ownership_model.md`; merge or rename diagnostic-only,
  duplicate, or thin-wrapper projects when they lack a real runtime, ABI,
  adapter, product, subsystem, dependency, or deployment boundary.
- Continue adding separate Visual Studio projects only for durable native
  systems instead of growing one monolithic runtime DLL.
- Use `GhostRigger.Core.Tools.{Toolname}` for C++ toolbox migrations and
  `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*` / `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Helpers.*` for
  visible UI and interaction-helper package boundaries.
- Add shared native projects for cross-toolbox contracts, handle management,
  descriptors, math, resource residency, diagnostics, and common runtime
  helpers.
- Create one renderer DLL package per renderer backend only when the backend has
  a real runtime/dependency boundary, with
  `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` as the diagnostic backend pattern
  and `GhostRigger.Core.Rendering` as the first hardware backend
  boundary.
- Use the native project templates for native toolbox DLLs, renderer DLLs, and
  real-project Debug verification targets so future agents add projects
  consistently.
- Add version and capability negotiation to every native package that Python can
  load.
- Add strict ownership documentation for all handle lifetimes crossing the
  Python/C++ boundary.
- Keep Python adapters under `src/adapters/` thin: load DLLs, marshal payloads,
  normalize diagnostics, and call existing core ports.

Phase 1 acceptance:

- The solution builds Debug and Release x64.
- Release solution output contains only shippable `.exe`, `.dll`, and `.lib`
  files; it does not contain `.pdb`, `.exp`, or Debug-only validation artifacts.
- Each native package has a real Debug target or a targeted ABI check.
- Python can detect package availability and report capabilities for native
  packages without starting the GUI.
- Missing native packages fall back cleanly.
- `knowledge_base/native_migration_plan.md`, `native/README.md`, and this file
  agree on the current ownership model.

## Phase 2: Building Work

Purpose: bring the native pieces together so they work as a coordinated runtime
instead of isolated proof-of-concept DLLs.

Phase 2 work areas:

- Retained scene residency: native scene handles, mesh handles, material
  handles, texture handles, skin-palette handles, generation counters, and
  lifetime diagnostics.
- Model runtime bridge: mesh descriptors, vertex/index buffers, dirty range
  updates, transform updates, bounds, and resource upload plans.
- Animation runtime bridge: sampled pose payloads, palette updates,
  supermodel-related diagnostics, blending helpers, and CPU/GPU skinning
  handoff contracts.
- Skinning runtime: native CPU fallback, GPU skinning dispatch planning,
  palette residency, readback, deformation-aware bounds, and parity checks.
- Picking and culling: transformed bounds, CPU-skinned bounds where requested,
  ray queries, draw-list filtering, and later triangle/rendered picking.
- Renderer integration: renderer-contract implementation, resource residency,
  upload queues, state transitions, shader/pipeline state, draw submission, and
  frame statistics.
- Python adapter integration: existing `src.core.ports.*` and
  `src.adapters.*` paths call native packages behind stable interfaces.
- Failure/fallback integration: any unsupported feature returns diagnostics and
  falls back to the existing Python/renderer path instead of crashing.

Phase 2 acceptance:

- Targeted MCP comparisons confirm backend/model-pipeline parity before native
  parsing or transform behavior replaces Python behavior.
- Targeted Python tests cover adapters, fallback, diagnostics, and data
  marshalling.
- Native Debug targets or targeted ABI checks cover each DLL package
  independently.
- Visible GhostRigger checks confirm viewport/workflow behavior for the affected
  surface.
- Performance-sensitive paths show measurable improvement or lower frame-time
  variance before they are made default.

## Phase 3: Decorative And Presentation Integration

Purpose: connect native-backed systems to the product's visible identity and UI
objects without moving visual policy into C++.

Phase 3 covers:

- Graphical interface objects that expose native-backed features.
- Stable command IDs, button IDs, action names, and object names for native
  renderer/toolbox controls.
- Logo, SVG, icon, and handle resources used by the UI to represent native
  systems.
- Viewport manipulation handles, gizmo IDs, selection handles, helper handles,
  and renderer diagnostic overlays.
- Theme/layout integration for any new native-backed visible controls.
- Settings and capability presentation for renderer packages and toolbox DLLs.

Phase 3 rules:

- UI assets remain in the GUI/resource layer, not buried inside renderer DLLs.
- Native systems may expose capability flags and stable IDs; Python/Qt decides
  how to display them.
- New visible UI must use theme tokens and layout metrics, not hardcoded Matrix
  colours or fixed sizes.
- New workflow controls belong in their owning workbench/window/panel, not in
  the main viewport unless the main viewport is the actual owner.

Phase 3 acceptance:

- Default/native, Matrix, Droid, Dark, Light, and Classic themes remain legible.
- Layouts do not overflow or hide new controls.
- UI object names and command IDs are stable enough for IPC/visual QA.
- Visible app testing confirms the actual workflow, not only backend probes.

## Phase 4: Final Polishing

Purpose: make the native-hosted product feel finished, dependable, and safe for
daily use.

Phase 4 work areas:

- Startup polish: native host messaging, failure reporting, missing-runtime
  prompts, and release-mode logging behavior.
- Packaging polish: DLL placement, dependency discovery, version reporting,
  release manifests, and updater/install notes.
- Performance polish: frame pacing, memory pressure, upload scheduling,
  background loading, cache eviction, and renderer fallback cost.
- Diagnostics polish: user-facing native capability summaries, developer-level
  detailed diagnostics, and regression artifacts.
- Safety polish: crash containment where possible, clean shutdown, handle leak
  checks, stale resource detection, and fallback paths.
- Documentation polish: update knowledge base, native README, project templates,
  and change log after each completed native slice.

Phase 4 acceptance:

- Debug and Release x64 builds pass targeted native and Python checks.
- The actual application starts, renders, and closes cleanly through the native
  host.
- Native renderer/toolbox packages report clear capabilities and failure
  reasons.
- The default path is faster, more stable, or more capable than the old path on
  the targeted fixture.
- The previous Python behavior remains available as a fallback until the native
  path has enough coverage to remove it deliberately.

## Migration Gate Checklist

Before making any native system authoritative, confirm:

- Owning product surface is named.
- Owning native project is named.
- Shared dependencies are in shared projects, not duplicated.
- Python bridge shape is documented.
- Handles have explicit lifetime rules.
- Version/capability negotiation exists.
- Missing-DLL and unsupported-feature fallback exists.
- Targeted native Debug target or ABI check exists.
- Targeted Python adapter test exists.
- MCP comparison has been run for backend/model-pipeline truth when applicable.
- Visible app workflow has been tested when UI/viewport/startup behavior is
  affected.
- `CHANGES.md` records the completed slice and verification.

## Immediate Next Native Foundation Tasks

1. Use `native/templates/` for the next renderer/toolbox/shared DLL package and
   choose the canonical owner from `knowledge_base/package_ownership_model.md`.
   Keep names under `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation.{System}` or
   `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared.{System}` only when the package is genuinely
   shared native/runtime infrastructure rather than product-surface-specific.
2. Move the next renderer-neutral payload contract from `GhostRigger.Runtime.Core.Host`
   into `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` once another runtime/renderer package needs
   it.
3. Extend `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` when future renderer-neutral
   mesh, material, frame, draw-list, or resource-residency payloads need stable
   shared schema metadata.
4. Extend `GhostRigger.Runtime.Shared` when future renderer-neutral
   upload, residency, transition, or resource-handle payloads need stable shared
   schema metadata.
5. Extend the Python-side native package registry entries as each native
   toolbox, renderer, or shared package gains version/capability exports.
6. Move reusable handle code into `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation`, reusable
   diagnostic record/schema code into `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation`,
   and reusable bounds/matrix helpers into `GhostRigger.Native.Core.Foundation`
   when another package needs them.
7. Extend the Python-side native package registry entries as each native package
   gains version/capability exports.
8. Document the first concrete toolbox, GUI Display, GUI Helpers, or renderer
   DLL candidate before implementing it, including its canonical project name,
   owner, bridge surface, tests, and fallback path.
9. Keep `knowledge_base/native_toolbox_window_migration_candidates.md` updated
   before implementing `GhostRigger.Core.Tools.*`,
   `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Display.*`, or `GhostRigger.Core.GUI.Helpers.*`
   packages.
